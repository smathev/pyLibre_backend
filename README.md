# Self-Hosted Library Manager with Kobo Synchronization

This project aims to replicate some of Calibre's functions, providing a self-hosted Python-developed backend for library management and Kobo synchronization using FastAPI.

## Features

- **Library Management:** Manage your eBook collection with ease.
- **Kobo Synchronization:** Sync your eBooks with Kobo devices.
- **User Authentication:** Secure access to your library.
- **RESTful API:** Integrate with other tools and services.
- **Interactive API Documentation:** Automatically generated by FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Kobo device (for synchronization)

## Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/smathev/pylib_backend.git
    cd pylib_backend
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:

    ```plaintext
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
    KOBO_API_KEY=your_kobo_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. Access the interactive API documentation by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
2. Use the provided endpoints to manage your library and synchronize with your Kobo device.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides a RESTful API for interacting with the library. Below are some of the available endpoints:

- `GET /api/books` - Retrieve a list of all books.
- `POST /api/books` - Add a new book.
- `GET /api/books/{id}` - Retrieve a specific book by ID.
- `PUT /api/books/{id}` - Update a specific book by ID.
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}` - Delete a specific book by ID.
- `POST /api/sync` - Sync the library with a Kobo device.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to the interactive [API Docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
